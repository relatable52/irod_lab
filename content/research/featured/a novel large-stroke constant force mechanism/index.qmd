title: "A Novel Large-Stroke Constant Force Mechanism"
image: large-stroke.avif
description: "This work presents the design of a novel adjustable constant-force mechanism (CFM) using a geared Sarrus linkage and a linear spring. The uniqueness of this design is that it provides a constant force over a wide range of displacement and the constant-force level can be adjusted energy-freely by varying the spring position without a preload. In this work, the construction, geometric constraints, and constant-force design of the CFM are expressed. The desired parameters of the mechanism, with consideration of gear friction, are also determined. A numerical example is then given to illustrate the constant-force performance and the effect of gear friction. This paper also shows a prototype of a CFM and experimental studies on it. It was found that the CFM delivered a constant force of up to 20 N within a stroke of 140 mm, and the force error was less than 6%. Moreover, the CFM compensated for masses of 1 and 2 kg with a torque reduction of more than 90%."
