abstract="This paper presents a novel adjustable constant-force mechanism (ACFM) based on spring and gear transmission. The mechanism is constructed by combining two gear-spring units and a Sarrus linkage. The significance of this design is that it can provide a constant force, which can be adjustable, over a large displacement. The adjustment of the output force is energy-free through a change in the spring position without spring preload. This work first explains the geometric constraints and desired parameters of the ACFM. Then, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the performance of the mechanism. Moreover, this paper also shows a prototype and experiments with an ACFM. It was found that the ACFM could provide a constant force of up to 20 N within a range of 140 mm, and the force error is less than 6{\%}.",

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel adjustable constant-force mechanism (CFM) using a geared Sarrus linkage and a linear spring. The uniqueness of this design is that it provides a constant force over a wide range of displacement and the constant-force level can be adjusted energy-freely by varying the spring position without a preload. In this work, the construction, geometric constraints, and constant-force design of the CFM are expressed. The desired parameters of the mechanism, with consideration of gear friction, are also determined. A numerical example is then given to illustrate the constant-force performance and the effect of gear friction. This paper also shows a prototype of a CFM and experimental studies on it. It was found that the CFM delivered a constant force of up to 20 N within a stroke of 140 mm, and the force error was less than 6%. Moreover, the CFM compensated for masses of 1 and 2 kg with a torque reduction of more than 90%.}
